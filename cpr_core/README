The purpose of this README is to provide you with instructions on how to build
the CPR Code.

Prior to building the CPR, you will need to need to configure hibernate.cfg.xml
with the database information, you will find this file in the src directory.
You will need to specify the following properties:

<property name="hibernate.connection.password"></property>
<property name="hibernate.connection.url"></property>
<property name="hibernate.connection.username"></property>
                
NOTE: the default build for the CPR assumes a MySQL database, however you can
specify any database for which there is a hibernate dialect for.  See this 
page for the list of hibernate dialects:

http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.5/api/org/hibernate/dialect/package-summary.html

You will update the hibernate dialect in this line:

<property name="hibernate.dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect</property>

In addition, you will need to update the database connection class with the
correct JDBC driver:

<property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class">com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</property>

And finally you will need to place the vendor's JDBC driver jar in the build-jars 
folder.  Currently the CPR ships with the Oracle and MySQL drivers as a 
convenience for the user.

The last change you will need to make would be if the database you have installed 
differs in name from "cpr", you will need to update the default schema property with
the database name:

<property name="hibernate.default_schema">cpr</property>

Next, you will need to update the cpr.properties file, located in the src folder.

#
# JMS
#
cpr.jms.broker=
cpr.jms.userid=
cpr.jms.password=
cpr.jms.replyto=Queue.CPR

You will need to specify values for the above properties to configure the CPR to use
JMS.

And finally you need to specify the name of the CPR database (see above).

#
# Database Information
#
cpr.database.name=cpr

After you complete these steps you can build the cpr core software, by just
typing ant from the main directory.  If you want to run unit tests, you will
need to specify a parameter to the ant command -Drun.unit.tests=1

When you build the code, the javadoc will be placed in the javadoc folder and
the cpr_core.jar will be placed in the dist/lib folder.
