This README details how to build the CPR Web Services.  It is assumed that
you have build the CPR Core prior to building these services.  Also, you need
to make sure when you clone the github, you pull cpr_core, cprws, and cprws_test.

From a building perspective, all you need to is just run "ant" to build
the services, it will generate a file called cprws.war in the dist/lib 
directory.  That will be the file you will need to install on your application
server.
