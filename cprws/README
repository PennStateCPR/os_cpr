This README details how to build the CPR Web Services.  It is assumed that
you have build the CPR Core prior to building these services.  Also, you need
to make sure when you clone the github, you pull cpr_core, cprws, and cprws_test.

You will be using Apache's "ant" to build the software.  The build software uses
Apache's ivy to resolve dependencies and create a single WAR file containing all
of the required jars.  Refer to the Ivy FAQ for more information: 

http://ant.apache.org/ivy/faq.html

You need to make sure you have the latest Apache Ant installed
http://ant.apache.org/

And ANT_HOME needs to point to the location where you installed it and $ANT_HOME/bin
needs to be in your path.

To build the software just execute "ant".  If everything is set up correctly,
it will download the dependencies and build a resultant war file which
you can deploy on your server.  The war file (cprws.war) will be located
in the dist/lib folder.
