The purpose of the Prime CPR program is to prime the CPR with initial data
that is needed for the unit and integration tests.  To utilize this utility
you must have created the CPR database.  

What follows are the steps you need to perform to prime the CPR database:

1)  Build cpr_core.
    ** cd cpr_core
    ** ant
2)	cd ../cpr_prime
3)	In the source folder you will find the hibernate.cfg.example file, you will
	need to fill in values related to the database connection.  Make sure you
	save the file as hibernate.cfg.xml.  
4)	From the top level folder, just type "ant".  The build script will take
	care of downloading dependencies, building the source code and running the
	prime program
