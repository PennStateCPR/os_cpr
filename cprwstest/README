The source code contained within this project are for the CPR integration tests.
The integration tests exercise the functionality of the CPR to ensure that the
installed components function correctly.  The ant build files uses Apache's
Ivy to resolve dependencies necessary to build the tests.

To execute the intergration tests, you will need to first install the 
CPR Web Services on a server.  After you have completed that step, you
can execute the tests by typing:

ant -Dapp.hostname=URL to you server.

For example if you have installed the web services on a Tomcat instance that
uses http on port 8080, you would specify the following:

ant -Dapp.hostname=http://server.abc.edu:8080
