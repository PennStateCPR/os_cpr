This application provides an example of using ActiveMQ JMS to send a 
JSON formatted message to a topic.  The topic can then be read using 
either JMS or XMPP.  To utilize this code, you will need to have an
ActiveMQ installation set up with a topic which needs to be protected
by a userid/password.  Penn State can provide more information about this
if needed.

To build the example program, just execute ant.
