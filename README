NOTE: sql.ddl is set up for MySQL, you will need to update it accordingly
for your database.
2) Install and configure your application server.
3) Install and configure JMS.
4) Build cpr_core (see its README for instructions).
5) Build cprws (see its README for instructions).
6) Deploy the cprws.war file onto your server.
7) Copy the cpr.properties and hibernate.cfg.xml file to your server and place
them in the classpath of the application server.
8) Copy the contents of the cpr_core/build-jars folder to your server and place 
them in the classpath of the application server.
9) Copy the DROOLS rules file (cpr_core/src/*.drl) to your server and
