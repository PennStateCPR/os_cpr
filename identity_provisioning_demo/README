This README details the steps necessary to build the Open Source version
of the Identity Provisioning software.  The Identity Provisioning software is
graphical user interface designed for allowing entities to self-service
create an identity in the Central Person Registry.  The interface with the
registry is accessed via APIs.  In addition to the interface, cpr_core,
and cpr web services the UI requires a messaging infrastructure set up to 
process requests to create identities.  This is accomplished using ActiveMQ
messages.

Prior to building this UI, the cpr_core, CPR web services and the CPR 
database must be primed.  What follows are steps to build the software:

1)	In the src directory, you need to copy cpr.properties.examples to
cpr.properties.  Then you need to fill values for the ActiveMQ broker.

2)	In the src directory, you need to copy the hibernate.cfg.xml.example
file to the hibernate.cfg.xml file.  You will need to fill in the 
appropriate values for the database information.

3)	Assuming Apache ant is installed correctly, you just need to type
"ant" to build the software.

4)	Copy dist/lib/IdentityProvisioning.war to the webapps folder of your
tomcat instance.
