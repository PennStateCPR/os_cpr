The purpose of this README is to provide you with instructions on how to build
the Directory Provisioner Code.  The directory provisioner is an example of how
to accept messages from a queue and process them by updating LDAP.  The provisioner
should work with any LDAP server with the eduPerson schema installed.  It has
been tested using OpenLDAP.

1)  In the src folder, you will need to copy some files:
    *) cp cpr.properties.example cpr.properties.
    	
2)	Next you will need to copy the cpr.properties file, in the src folder, 
	cp cpr.properties.example cpr.properties
	
	#
	# JMS
	#
	cpr.jms.broker=
	cpr.jms.userid=
	cpr.jms.password=
	cpr.jms.replyto=Queue.CPR
	* Update the above lines with the location of the JMS instance and userid/password for a queue called
	Queue.CPR.


3)	Build the CPR code.
	* ant
	
8)	When you build the code, the javadoc will be placed in the javadoc folder and
	the directory_provisioner.jar will be placed in the dist/lib folder.
