The instructions contained in this file will aid you in the building and
installing the Penn State CPR.

Requirements:
-------------

1) Java JDK version 1.6.x
2) Gradle (latest). - http://www.gradle.org/
3) Apache Tomcat 7.x. - http://tomcat.apache.org/
4) Apache ActiveMQ 5.5.x - http://activemq.apache.org/
5) JBoss Drools 5.x - http://www.jboss.org/drools/
6) Internet2 Grouper - http://www.internet2.edu/grouper/
7) A relational database that is supported by hibernate - 
http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.5/api/org/hibernate/dialect/package-summary.html
   By default, the CPR source code ships with the JDBC driver for 
   MySQL and Oracle.  The default configuration is for MySQL.
   
NOTE: You can obtain most of these components that are already set up
for you, but obtaining a copy of the CPR QuickStart.  Refer to the
QuickStart_Instructions for more information.  NOTE: you will still
need a copy of Java JDK, Apache Ant and a database.
   
First Steps:
------------

1)	Obtain the CPR code from GitHub: git://github.com/PennStateCPR/os_cpr.git
2) 	Make sure your Java is set up correctly, JAVA_HOME is set to the location
	of where Java is installed and $JAVA_HOME/bin is in your path.
3) 	Install Gradle, make sure you set GRADLE_HOME to the location where you
	installed Gradle, and also add $GRADLE_HOME/bin to your $PATH.
4) 	Install Tomcat (refer to Apache's instructions on how to configure it).
5) 	Install ActiveMQ (refer to Apache's instructions on how to configure it).
6) 	Extract JBoss Drools into a directory.
7) 	Extract and install Internet2's grouper.  You need to find the grouperClient.jar
   	file and place it somewhere in Tomcat's classpath.  A recommended approach is
   	to create a directory hold all of the extra jars like this and then place
   	the location in the shared.loader configuration item in the Catalina.properties
   	file.
8) 	Add the Drools jars to the shared.loader path, just like you did for the
   	Grouper jars.
9) 	Create a properties directory and also add it to the shared.loader line.
10)	In the cpr_core directory of the GitHub distribution, you will find an
	sql.dll file.  By default this file is set up for MySQL, you will need to
	change it for your database platform.
11)	Create a database, database user, password and load the sql.dll file.
12)	In the src folder of the cpr_core folder, you will see two example
	files, hibernate.cfg.example and cpr.properties.example.
13)	Copy the hibernate.cfg.example file to hibernate.cfg.xml, and update
	the file in all of the places that say, "Put your...".
14)	Copy the cpr.properties.example to cpr.properties.
15)	The important line to change is the cpr.database.name, make sure that
	matches name of the database you created in step #11.
16)	Prime the CPR with data (see Prime_The_CPR) for more information.
	
Build CPR Core
--------------

The CPR Core contains the core code that is shared amoung the various services that
make up the CPR.  At the end of the build process, you will have a cpr_core.jar file
created for you.  Assuming that ant is installed as detailed above, all you need to do is:

1)	cd cpr_core folder.
2)	gradle

If you have installed ActiveMQ and updated the cpr.properties file with the proper information,
you will need to create two queues, Queue.CPR and Queue.UnitTest.  If you want to run the unit
tests enter: "ant -Drun.unit.tests=1"

Prime the CPR
-------------

Priming the CPR is necessary for ensuring it contains data values for the various types
that are using by the CPR.

1)	cd to the top level CPR directory
2)  gradle cpr_prime:run

Build The CPR Web Services
--------------------------

The CPR Web Services are SOAP-based and utilitize the cpr_core.jar that was built in the
previous step.  To build the services:

1) cd to the top level CPR directory
2) gradle cprws:assemble

In the build/libs directory, you will find cprws.war, deploy that to your server.

To build the RESTful services:

1) cd to the top level CPR directory
2) gradle cprapi:assemble

In the build/libs directory, you will find cprapi.war, deploy that to your server.

Running The Integration Tests
-----------------------------

The CPR comes with a set of tests that will exercise its various components to ensure
everything is running correctly.  To run the integration tests,

1)  cd to the top level CPR directory
2)  edit the gradle.properities file, and set the app_hostname to the location (URL)
    of where you installed the software.
3)  gradle cprwstest:test - run SOAP tests.
4)  gradle cprapi:test - run RESTful API tests.
