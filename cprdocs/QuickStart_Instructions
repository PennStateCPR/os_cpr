The information contained within this README detail the functionality,
requirements, and installation information for the Penn State Central Person
Registry (CPR).

Functionality
-------------

The functionality contained within this quickstart will enable you to 
execute SOAP services that are defined here:

https://wikispaces.psu.edu/display/IAM/Service+Design

The services accept a variety of inputs and return a SOAP-based XML document as
the result of its execution.  A future release of the CPR will include a
web-based component for Identity Provisioning.

Requirements
------------

To be able to use this quickstart, you will need to have the following installed
on your system:

1)	A version of the MySQL database (you can either install via a package
        or from source).
	*) You will need to have a CPR user and password created.  You can
	   use the root user if you want.
	*) In addition, you will need to create a cpr database, again you can
	   call it whatever you want.
	*) Here are some sample commands to create the user and database.
	   1) mysql -u root -p
       2) create database cpr;
       3) use mysql;
       4) create user 'cpruser'@'%' identified by 'pass';    
       5) grant all privileges on cpr.* to 'cpruser'@'%' identified by 'pass';
       6) flush privileges;
     *) Link to docs:
           http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/adding-users.html

2)	You need to create two users, activemq and tomcat.  Refer to your 
        operating system documentation for how to do this.  If you are
        running Linux, you can use the useradd command to create them.

3)      You need to have a version of Java 6 or higher installed.  Make sure
        your JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to the location of the
	JAVA_HOME.  On Linux systems it is typically installed in
	/usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.6.0-openjdk.x86_64, you can find the location
	by checking where java is installed.  It will be a symlink to
	somewhere, follow that symlink and you will have Java.  For
	MacOS, Java is located:
	/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK/Home

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1)  Contain the CPR development team via email for a link to the
    CPR quickstart (email cprdev@psu.edu).
2)	Create a directory on your system for the CPR, and make that
        your current directory.
3)	Extract the contents on the CPR quickstart using:
        "gzip -dc cpr-quickstart.tar.gz | tar xvfp -"
4)	Run the installation script (./install.sh).  Make sure you
        run the integration tests, they will tell you whether
        the CPR is working or not.
